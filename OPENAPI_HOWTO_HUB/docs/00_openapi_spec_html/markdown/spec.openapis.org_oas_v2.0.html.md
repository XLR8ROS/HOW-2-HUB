## What is the OpenAPI Specification?
The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.

### 2.1 Version 2.0
 
 The key words “ MUST ”, “ MUST NOT ”, “ REQUIRED ”, “ SHALL ”, “ SHALL NOT ”, “ SHOULD ”, “ SHOULD NOT ”, “ RECOMMENDED ”, “ MAY ”, and “ OPTIONAL ” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [ RFC2119 ].

 The Swagger specification is licensed under The Apache License, Version 2.0 .

 
## 3. Introductions
 
 Swagger™ is a project used to describe and document RESTful APIs.

 The Swagger specification defines a set of files required to describe such an API. These files can then be used by the Swagger-UI project to display the API and Swagger-Codegen to generate clients in various languages. Additional utilities can also take advantage of the resulting files, such as testing tools.

## 5. Definitions 
 
 
### 5.1 Path Templating 
 
 Path templating refers to the usage of curly braces ({}) to mark a section of a URL path as replaceable using path parameters.

 
### 5.2 Mime Types 
 
 Mime type definitions are spread across several resources. The mime type definitions should be in compliance with [ RFC6838 ].

 Some examples of possible mime type definitions:

```
` text/plain; charset=utf-8
 application/json
 application/vnd.github+json
 application/vnd.github.v3+json
 application/vnd.github.v3.raw+json
 application/vnd.github.v3.text+json
 application/vnd.github.v3.html+json
 application/vnd.github.v3.full+json
 application/vnd.github.v3.diff
 application/vnd.github.v3.patch
`
```

 
### 5.3 HTTP Status Codes 
 
 The HTTP Status Codes are used to indicate the status of the executed operation. The available status codes are described by [ RFC7231 ] Section 6 and in the IANA Status Code Registry .

 
## 6. Specification
 
 
### 6.1 Format
 
 The files describing the RESTful API in accordance with the Swagger specification are represented as JSON objects and conform to the JSON standards. YAML , being a superset of JSON, can be used as well to
represent a Swagger specification file.

 For example, if a field is said to have an array value, the JSON array representation will be used:

```
`{
 "field" : [...]
}
`
```

 While the API is described using JSON it does not impose a JSON input/output to the API itself.

 All field names in the specification are case sensitive .

 The schema exposes two types of fields. Fixed fields, which have a declared name, and Patterned fields, which declare a regex pattern for the field name. Patterned fields can have multiple occurrences as long as each has a unique name.

 
### 6.2 File Structure
 
 The Swagger representation of the API is made of a single file. However, parts of the definitions can be split into separate files, at the discretion of the user. This is applicable for `$ref` fields in the specification as follows from the JSON Schema definitions.

 By convention, the Swagger specification file is named `swagger.json`.

 
### 6.3 Data Types
 
 Primitive data types in the Swagger Specification are based on the types supported by the JSON-Schema Draft 4 . Models are described using the Schema Object which is a subset of JSON Schema Draft 4.

 An additional primitive data type `"file"` is used by the Parameter Object and the Response Object to set the parameter type or the response as being a file.

 Primitives have an optional modifier property `format`. Swagger uses several known formats to more finely define the data type being used. However, the `format` property is an open `string`-valued property, and can have any value to support documentation needs. Formats such as `"email"`, `"uuid"`, etc., can be used even though they are not defined by this specification. Types that are not accompanied by a `format` property follow their definition from the JSON Schema (except for `file` type which is defined above). The formats defined by the Swagger Specification are:

 
 
 
 Common Name 
 `type` 
 `format` 
 Comments 
 
 
 
 
 integer 
 `integer` 
 `int32` 
 signed 32 bits 
 
 
 long 
 `integer` 
 `int64` 
 signed 64 bits 
 
 
 float 
 `number` 
 `float` 
 
 
 
 double 
 `number` 
 `double` 
 
 
 
 string 
 `string` 
 
 
 
 
 byte 
 `string` 
 `byte` 
 base64 encoded characters 
 
 
 binary 
 `string` 
 `binary` 
 any sequence of octets 
 
 
 boolean 
 `boolean` 
 
 
 
 
 date 
 `string` 
 `date` 
 As defined by `full-date` - [ RFC3339 ] Section 5.6 
 
 
 dateTime 
 `string` 
 `date-time` 
 As defined by `date-time` - [ RFC3339 ] Section 5.6 
 
 
 password 
 `string` 
 `password` 
 Used to hint UIs the input needs to be obscured. 
 
 
 
 
### 6.4 Schema
 
 
#### 6.4.1 Swagger Object
 
 This is the root document object for the API specification. It combines what previously was the Resource Listing and API Declaration (version 1.2 and earlier) together into one document.

 6.4.1.1 Fixed Fields 
 
 
 
 Field Name 
 Type 
 Description 
 
 
 
 
 swagger 
 `string` 
 Required. Specifies the Swagger Specification version being used. It can be used by the Swagger UI and other clients to interpret the API listing. The value MUST be `"2.0"`. 
 
 
 info 
 Info Object 
 Required. Provides metadata about the API. The metadata can be used by the clients if needed. 
 
 
 host 
 `string` 
 The host (name or ip) serving the API. This MUST be the host only and does not include the scheme nor sub-paths. It MAY include a port. If the `host` is not included, the host serving the documentation is to be used (including the port). The `host` does not support path templating . 
 
 
 basePath 
 `string` 
 The base path on which the API is served, which is relative to the `host` . If it is not included, the API is served directly under the `host`. The value MUST start with a leading slash (`/`). The `basePath` does not support path templating . 
 
 
 schemes 
 [`string`] 
 The transfer protocol of the API. Values MUST be from the list: `"http"`, `"https"`, `"ws"`, `"wss"`. If the `schemes` is not included, the default scheme to be used is the one used to access the Swagger definition itself. 
 
 
 consumes 
 [`string`] 
 A list of MIME types the APIs can consume. This is global to all APIs but can be overridden on specific API calls. Value MUST be as described under Mime Types . 
 
 
 produces 
 [`string`] 
 A list of MIME types the APIs can produce. This is global to all APIs but can be overridden on specific API calls. Value MUST be as described under Mime Types . 
 
 
 paths

 Required. The available paths and operations for the API. 
 
 
 definitions 
 Definitions Object 
 An object to hold data types produced and consumed by operations. 
 
 
 parameters 
 Parameters Definitions Object 
 An object to hold parameters that can be used across operations. This property does not define global parameters for all operations.

 Responses Definitions Object 
 An object to hold responses that can be used across operations. This property does not define global responses for all operations. 
 
 
 securityDefinitions 
 Security Definitions Object 
 Security scheme definitions that can be used across the specification. 
 
 
 security 
 [ Security Requirement Object ] 
 A declaration of which security schemes are applied for the API as a whole. The list of values describes alternative security schemes that can be used (that is, there is a logical OR between the security requirements). Individual operations can override this definition. 
 
 
 tags 
 [ Tag Object ] 
 A list of tags used by the specification with additional metadata. The order of the tags can be used to reflect on their order by the parsing tools. Not all tags that are used by the Operation Object must be declared. The tags that are not declared may be organized randomly or based on the tools’ logic. Each tag name in the list MUST be unique.

 6.4.7.1 Fixed Fields 
 
 
 
 Field Name 
 Type 
 Description 
 
 
 
 
 tags 
 [`string`] 
 A list of tags for API documentation control. Tags can be used for logical grouping of operations by resources or any other qualifier. 
 
 
 summary 
 `string` 
 A short summary of what the operation does. For maximum readability in the swagger-ui, this field SHOULD be less than 120 characters. 
 
 
 description 
 `string` 
 A verbose explanation of the operation behavior. GFM syntax can be used for rich text representation. 
 
 
 externalDocs 
 External Documentation Object 
 Additional external documentation for this operation. 
 
 
 operationId 
 `string` 
 Unique string used to identify the operation. The id MUST be unique among all operations described in the API. Tools and libraries MAY use the operationId to uniquely identify an operation, therefore, it is recommended to follow common programming naming conventions. 
 
 
 consumes 
 [`string`] 
 A list of MIME types the operation can consume. This overrides the `consumes` definition at the Swagger Object. An empty value MAY be used to clear the global definition. Value MUST be as described under Mime Types . 
 
 
 produces 
 [`string`] 
 A list of MIME types the operation can produce. This overrides the `produces` definition at the Swagger Object. An empty value MAY be used to clear the global definition. Value MUST be as described under Mime Types . 
 
 
 parameters 
 [ Parameter Object | Reference Object ] 
 A list of parameters that are applicable for this operation. If a parameter is already defined at the Path Item , the new definition will override it, but can never remove it. The list MUST NOT include duplicated parameters. A unique parameter is defined by a combination of a name and location . The list can use the Reference Object to link to parameters that are defined at the Swagger Object’s parameters . There can be one “body” parameter at most. 
 
 
 responses 
 Responses Object 
 Required. The list of possible responses as they are returned from executing this operation. 
 
 
 schemes 
 [`string`] 
 The transfer protocol for the operation. Values MUST be from the list: `"http"`, `"https"`, `"ws"`, `"wss"`. The value overrides the Swagger Object `schemes` definition. 
 
 
 deprecated 
 `boolean` 
 Declares this operation to be deprecated. Usage of the declared operation should be refrained. Default value is `false`. 
 
 
 security 
 [ Security Requirement Object ] 
 A declaration of which security schemes are applied for this operation. The list of values describes alternative security schemes that can be used (that is, there is a logical OR between the security requirements). This definition overrides any declared top-level `security` . To remove a top-level security declaration, an empty array can be used.

`
```

 
#### 6.4.9 Parameter Object
 
 Describes a single operation parameter.

 A unique parameter is defined by a combination of a name and location .

 There are five possible parameter types.

 

- Path - Used together with Path Templating , where the parameter value is actually part of the operation’s URL. This does not include the host or base path of the API. For example, in `/items/{itemId}`, the path parameter is `itemId`. 

- Query - Parameters that are appended to the URL. For example, in `/items?id=###`, the query parameter is `id`. 

- Header - Custom headers that are expected as part of the request. 

- Body - The payload that’s appended to the HTTP request. Since there can only be one payload, there can only be one body parameter. The name of the body parameter has no effect on the parameter itself and is used for documentation purposes only. Since Form parameters are also in the payload, body and form parameters cannot exist together for the same operation. 

- Form - Used to describe the payload of an HTTP request when either `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data` or both are used as the content type of the request (in Swagger’s definition, the `consumes` property of an operation). This is the only parameter type that can be used to send files, thus supporting the `file` type. Since form parameters are sent in the payload, they cannot be declared together with a body parameter for the same operation. Form parameters have a different format based on the content-type used (for further details, consult [ HTML401 ] Section 17.13.4 :
 

- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` - Similar to the format of Query parameters but as a payload. For example, `foo=1&bar=swagger` - both `foo` and `bar` are form parameters. This is normally used for simple parameters that are being transferred. 

- `multipart/form-data` - each parameter takes a section in the payload with an internal header. For example, for the header `Content-Disposition: form-data; name="submit-name"` the name of the parameter is `submit-name`. This type of form parameters is more commonly used for file transfers.

 Required. The name of the parameter. Parameter names are case sensitive . 
- If `in` is `"path"`, the `name` field MUST correspond to the associated path segment from the path field in the Paths Object . See Path Templating for further information. 
- For all other cases, the `name` corresponds to the parameter name used based on the `in` property. 
 
 
 in 
 `string` 
 Required. The location of the parameter. Possible values are “query”, “header”, “path”, “formData” or “body”. 
 
 
 description 
 `string` 
 A brief description of the parameter. This could contain examples of use. GFM syntax can be used for rich text representation. 
 
 
 required 
 `boolean` 
 Determines whether this parameter is mandatory. If the parameter is `in` “path”, this property is required and its value MUST be `true`. Otherwise, the property MAY be included and its default value is `false`.

 Field Name 
 Type 
 Description 
 
 
 
 
 type 
 `string` 
 Required. The type of the parameter. Since the parameter is not located at the request body, it is limited to simple types (that is, not an object). The value MUST be one of `"string"`, `"number"`, `"integer"`, `"boolean"`, `"array"` or `"file"`. If `type` is `"file"`, the `consumes` MUST be either `"multipart/form-data"`, `" application/x-www-form-urlencoded"` or both and the parameter MUST be `in` `"formData"`. 
 
 
 format 
 `string` 
 The extending format for the previously mentioned `type` . See Data Type Formats for further details. 
 
 
 allowEmptyValue 
 `boolean` 
 Sets the ability to pass empty-valued parameters. This is valid only for either `query` or `formData` parameters and allows you to send a parameter with a name only or an empty value. Default value is `false`. 
 
 
 items 
 Items Object 
 Required if `type` is “array”. Describes the type of items in the array. 
 
 
 collectionFormat 
 `string` 
 Determines the format of the array if type array is used. Possible values are: 
- `csv` - comma separated values `foo,bar`. 
- `ssv` - space separated values `foo bar`. 
- `tsv` - tab separated values `foo\tbar`. 
- `pipes` - pipe separated values `foo|bar`. 
- `multi` - corresponds to multiple parameter instances instead of multiple values for a single instance `foo=bar&foo=baz`. This is valid only for parameters `in` “query” or “formData”. Default value is `csv`. 
 
 
 default 
 * 
 Declares the value of the parameter that the server will use if none is provided, for example a “count” to control the number of results per page might default to 100 if not supplied by the client in the request. (Note: “default” has no meaning for required parameters.) See https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fge-json-schema-validation-00#section-6.2 .

#### 6.4.11 Responses Object
 
 A container for the expected responses of an operation. The container maps a HTTP response code to the expected response. It is not expected from the documentation to necessarily cover all possible HTTP response codes, since they may not be known in advance. However, it is expected from the documentation to cover a successful operation response and any known errors.

 The `default` can be used as the default response object for all HTTP codes that are not covered individually by the specification.

 The `Responses Object` MUST contain at least one response code, and it SHOULD be the response for a successful operation call.

 Rate-limit headers:

```
`{
 "X-Rate-Limit-Limit" : {
 "description" : "The number of allowed requests in the current period" ,
 "type" : "integer" 
 },
 "X-Rate-Limit-Remaining" : {
 "description" : "The number of remaining requests in the current period" ,
 "type" : "integer" 
 },
 "X-Rate-Limit-Reset" : {
 "description" : "The number of seconds left in the current period" ,
 "type" : "integer" 
 }
}
`
```

```
` X-Rate-Limit-Limit: 
 description: The number of allowed requests in the current period 
 type: integer 
 X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: 
 description: The number of remaining requests in the current period 
 type: integer 
 X-Rate-Limit-Reset: 
 description: The number of seconds left in the current period

`
```

 
#### 6.4.18 Schema Object
 
 The Schema Object allows the definition of input and output data types. These types can be objects, but also primitives and arrays. This object is based on the JSON Schema Specification Draft 4 and uses a predefined subset of it. On top of this subset, there are extensions provided by this specification to allow for more complete documentation.

 Further information about the properties can be found in JSON Schema Core and JSON Schema Validation . Unless stated otherwise, the property definitions follow the JSON Schema specification as referenced here.

 The following properties are taken directly from the JSON Schema definition and follow the same specifications:

 

- $ref - As a JSON Reference 

- format (See Data Type Formats for further details) 

- title 

- description ( GFM syntax can be used for rich text representation) 

- default (Unlike JSON Schema, the value MUST conform to the defined type for the Schema Object) 

- multipleOf 

- maximum 

- exclusiveMaximum 

- minimum 

- exclusiveMinimum 

- maxLength 

- minLength 

- pattern 

- maxItems 

- minItems 

- uniqueItems 

- maxProperties 

- minProperties 

- required 

- enum 

- type 
 
 The following properties are taken from the JSON Schema definition but their definitions were adjusted to the Swagger Specification. Their definition is the same as the one from JSON Schema, only where the original definition references the JSON Schema definition, the Schema Object definition is used instead.

 

- items 

- allOf 

- properties 

- additionalProperties 
 
 Other than the JSON Schema subset fields, the following fields may be used for further schema documentation.

 6.4.18.1 Fixed Fields 
 
 
 
 Field Name 
 Type 
 Description 
 
 
 
 
 discriminator 
 `string` 
 Adds support for polymorphism. The discriminator is the schema property name that is used to differentiate between other schema that inherit this schema. The property name used MUST be defined at this schema and it MUST be in the `required` property list. When used, the value MUST be the name of this schema or any schema that inherits it. 
 
 
 readOnly 
 `boolean` 
 Relevant only for Schema `"properties"` definitions. Declares the property as “read only”. This means that it MAY be sent as part of a response but MUST NOT be sent as part of the request. Properties marked as `readOnly` being `true` SHOULD NOT be in the `required` list of the defined schema. Default value is `false`. 
 
 
 xml 
 XML Object 
 This MAY be used only on properties schemas. It has no effect on root schemas. Adds Additional metadata to describe the XML representation format of this property. 
 
 
 externalDocs 
 External Documentation Object 
 Additional external documentation for this schema. 
 
 
 example 
 Any 
 A free-form property to include an example of an instance for this schema. 
 
 
 
 6.4.18.2 Patterned Objects 
 
 
 
 Field Pattern 
 Type 
 Description 
 
 
 
 
 ^x- 
 Any 
 Allows extensions to the Swagger Schema. The field name MUST begin with `x-`, for example, `x-internal-id`. The value can be `null`, a primitive, an array or an object. See Vendor Extensions for further details. 
 
 
 
 6.4.18.2.1 Composition and Inheritance (Polymorphism) 
 Swagger allows combining and extending model definitions using the `allOf` property of JSON Schema, in effect offering model composition. `allOf` takes in an array of object definitions that are validated independently but together compose a single object.

 While composition offers model extensibility, it does not imply a hierarchy between the models. To support polymorphism, Swagger adds the support of the `discriminator` field. When used, the `discriminator` will be the name of the property used to decide which schema definition is used to validate the structure of the model. As such, the `discriminator` field MUST be a required field. The value of the chosen property has to be the friendly name given to the model under the `definitions` property. As such, inline schema definitions, which do not have a given id, cannot be used in polymorphism.

 6.4.18.2.2 XML Modeling 
 The xml property allows extra definitions when translating the JSON definition to XML. The XML Object contains additional information about the available options.

 6.4.18.3 Schema Object Examples 
 6.4.18.3.1 Primitive Sample 
 Unlike previous versions of Swagger, Schema definitions can be used to describe primitive and arrays as well.

```
`{
 "type" : "string" ,
 "format" : "email" 
}
`
```

```
` type: string 
 format: email 
`
```

 6.4.18.3.2 Simple Model

#### 6.4.19 XML Object
 
 A metadata object that allows for more fine-tuned XML model definitions.

 When using arrays, XML element names are not inferred (for singular/plural forms) and the `name` property should be used to add that information. See examples for expected behavior.

 6.4.19.1 Fixed Fields 
 
 
 
 Field Name 
 Type 
 Description 
 
 
 
 
 name 
 `string` 
 Replaces the name of the element/attribute used for the described schema property. When defined within the Items Object (`items`), it will affect the name of the individual XML elements within the list. When defined alongside `type` being `array` (outside the `items`), it will affect the wrapping element and only if `wrapped` is `true`. If `wrapped` is `false`, it will be ignored. 
 
 
 namespace 
 `string` 
 The URL of the namespace definition. Value SHOULD be in the form of a URL. 
 
 
 prefix 
 `string` 
 The prefix to be used for the name . 
 
 
 attribute 
 `boolean` 
 Declares whether the property definition translates to an attribute instead of an element. Default value is `false`. 
 
 
 wrapped 
 `boolean` 
 MAY be used only for an array definition. Signifies whether the array is wrapped (for example, `<books><book/><book/></books>`) or unwrapped (`<book/><book/>`). Default value is `false`. The definition takes effect only when defined alongside `type` being `array` (outside the `items`). 
 
 
 
 6.4.19.2 Patterned Objects 
 
 
 
 Field Pattern 
 Type 
 Description 
 
 
 
 
 ^x- 
 Any 
 Allows extensions to the Swagger Schema. The field name MUST begin with `x-`, for example, `x-internal-id`. The value can be `null`, a primitive, an array or an object. See Vendor Extensions for further details. 
 
 
 
 6.4.19.3 XML Object Examples 
 The examples of the XML object definitions are included inside a property definition of a Schema Object with a sample of the XML representation of it.

 6.4.19.3.1 No XML Element 
 Basic string property:

```
`{
 "animals" : {
 "type" : "string" 
 }
}
`
```

```
` animals: 
 type: string 
`
```

```
` < animals > ... </ animals > 
`
```

 Basic string array property ( `wrapped` is `false` by default):

```
`{
 "animals" : {
 "type" : "array" ,
 "items" : {
 "type" : "string" 
 }
 }
}
`
```

```
` animals: 
 type: array 
 items: 
 type: string 
`
```

```
` < animals > ... </ animals > 
 < animals > ... </ animals > 
 < animals > ... </ animals > 
`
```

 6.4.19.3.2 XML Name Replacement 

```
`{
 "animals" : {
 "type" : "string" ,
 "xml" : {
 "name" : "animal" 
 }
 }
}
`
```

```
` animals: 
 type: string 
 xml: 
 name: animal 
`
```

```
` < animal > ... </ animal > 
`
```

 6.4.19.3.3 XML Attribute, Prefix and Namespace 
 In this example, a full model definition is shown.

```
`{
 "Person" : {
 "type" : "object" ,
 "properties" : {
 "id" : {
 "type" : "integer" ,
 "format" : "int32" ,
 "xml" : {
 "attribute" : true 
 }
 },
 "name" : {
 "type" : "string" ,
 "xml" : {
 "namespace" : "http://swagger.io/schema/sample" ,
 "prefix" : "sample" 
 }
 }
 }
 }
}
`
```

```
` Person: 
 type: object 
 properties: 
 id: 
 type: integer 
 format: int32 
 xml: 
 attribute: true 
 name: 
 type: string 
 xml: 
 namespace: http://swagger.io/schema/sample 
 prefix: sample 
`
```

```
` < Person id = "123" > 
 < sample:name xmlns:sample = "http://swagger.io/schema/sample" > example </ sample:name > 
 </ Person > 
`
```

 6.4.19.3.4 XML Arrays 
 Changing the element names:

```
`{
 "animals" : {
 "type" : "array" ,
 "items" : {
 "type" : "string" ,
 "xml" : {
 "name" : "animal" 
 }
 }
 }
}
`
```

```
` animals: 
 type: array 
 items: 
 type: string 
 xml: 
 name: animal 
`
```

```
` < animal > value </ animal > 
 < animal > value </ animal > 
`
```

 The external `name` property has no effect on the XML:

```
`{
 "animals" : {
 "type" : "array" ,
 "items" : {
 "type" : "string" ,
 "xml" : {
 "name" : "animal" 
 }
 },
 "xml" : {
 "name" : "aliens" 
 }
 }
}
`
```

```
` animals: 
 type: array 
 items: 
 type: string 
 xml: 
 name: animal 
 xml: 
 name: aliens 
`
```

```
` < animal > value </ animal > 
 < animal > value </ animal > 
`
```

 Even when the array is wrapped, if no name is explicitly defined, the same name will be used both internally and externally:

```
`{
 "animals" : {
 "type" : "array" ,
 "items" : {
 "type" : "string" 
 },
 "xml" : {
 "wrapped" : true 
 }
 }
}
`
```

```
` animals: 
 type: array 
 items: 
 type: string 
 xml: 
 wrapped: true 
`
```

```
` < animals > 
 < animals > value </ animals > 
 < animals > value </ animals > 
 </ animals > 
`
```

 To overcome the above example, the following definition can be used:

```
`{
 "animals" : {
 "type" : "array" ,
 "items" : {
 "type" : "string" ,
 "xml" : {
 "name" : "animal" 
 }
 },
 "xml" : {
 "wrapped" : true 
 }
 }
}
`
```

```
` animals: 
 type: array 
 items: 
 type: string 
 xml: 
 name: animal 
 xml: 
 wrapped: true 
`
```

```
` < animals > 
 < animal > value </ animal > 
 < animal > value </ animal > 
 </ animals > 
`
```

 Affecting both internal and external names:

```
`{
 "animals" : {
 "type" : "array" ,
 "items" : {
 "type" : "string" ,
 "xml" : {
 "name" : "animal" 
 }
 },
 "xml" : {
 "name" : "aliens" ,
 "wrapped" : true 
 }
 }
}
`
```

```
` animals: 
 type: array 
 items: 
 type: string 
 xml: 
 name: animal 
 xml: 
 name: aliens 
 wrapped: true 
`
```

```
` < aliens > 
 < animal > value </ animal > 
 < animal > value </ animal > 
 </ aliens > 
`
```

 If we change the external element but not the internal ones:

```
`{
 "animals" : {
 "type" : "array" ,
 "items" : {
 "type" : "string" 
 },
 "xml" : {
 "name" : "aliens" ,
 "wrapped" : true 
 }
 }
}
`
```

```
` animals: 
 type: array 
 items: 
 type: string 
 xml: 
 name: aliens 
 wrapped: true 
`
```

```
` < aliens > 
 < aliens > value </ aliens > 
 < aliens > value </ aliens > 
 </ aliens > 
`
```

### 6.5 Specification Extensions
 
 While the Swagger Specification tries to accommodate most use cases, additional data can be added to extend the specification at certain points.

 The extensions properties are always prefixed by `"x-"` and can have any valid JSON format value.

 The extensions may or may not be supported by the available tooling, but those may be extended as well to add requested support (if tools are internal or open-sourced).

 
### 6.6 Security Filtering
 
 Some objects in the Swagger specification may be declared and remain empty, or completely be removed, even though they are inherently the core of the API documentation.

 The reasoning behind it is to allow an additional layer of access control over the documentation itself. While not part of the specification itself, certain libraries may choose to allow access to parts of the documentation based on some form of authentication/authorization.

 Two examples for this:

 

- The Paths Object may be empty. It may be counterintuitive, but this may tell the viewer that they got to the right place, but can’t access any documentation. They’d still have access to the Info Object which may contain additional information regarding authentication. 

- The Path Item Object may be empty. In this case, the viewer will be aware that the path exists, but will not be able to see any of its operations or parameters. This is different than hiding the path itself from the Paths Object so the user will not be aware of its existence. This allows the documentation provider a finer control over what the viewer can see.
